# Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying Combinatorial Metamaterials
This is the code repository accompanying the paper 'XXX' as published in 'XXX'. 
The code in this repository can be used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify unit cells of a combinatorial metamaterial into compatible (C) and incompatible (I) designs as described in the paper. Additionally, this repository includes the code used to preprocess the unit cell designs to form the training and test sets, and the code used to analyse and make figures of the results of the trained CNNs.

The dataset containing the trained CNN configurations, training data, and test data used in the paper can be downloaded from XXX.
The dataset containing the unit cells and their class can be downloaded from XXX.
The code used to generate the unit cells and their class can be found at XXX.
